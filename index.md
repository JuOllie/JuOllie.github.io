As a part of my final year at undergrad school, I'm currently pursuing my third internship at the Indian Institute of Science, on classification and semantic segmentation of wireless capsule endoscopy images. I have been associated with the Spectrum Lab and CVAI Lab, guided by Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula and Prof. K.R Ramakrishnan respectively.



### My core areas of work include the following:

- Steerable filters
- Semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, classification and detection for abnormalities in bio-medical images
- Apps for Indic script recognition
- Fast bilateral filters and fast bilateral edge detectors
- Transliteration of Indic scene text (Kannada)



I’ve always been intrigued by mathematics, problem solving, logical reasoning, analytical thinking and cracking puzzles-the whole enchilada. Technology to me, is an extension of the same ideology; it’s a culmination of all the above with an addition of innovation and creativity. An aspiring researcher, I wish to gain exposure to the plethora of technological fields, build optimised solutions and implement my ideas into reality,  for the betterment of the society. My research interests vastly lie in the domains of image processing, deep learning for bio-medical imaging, data mining and computer vision.

Over my undergraduate years at the Manipal Institute of Technology, I’ve had the privilege to be associated with a number of mentorship programs and technical clubs like IECSE, Google Developers’ Group, Women Techmakers Manipal and ACM- Women Manipal.
