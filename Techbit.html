      			<p>I am fortunate to have interned at the Indian Institute of Science, India's premier research insitution. I have served as a summer intern for three years and am currently working as a research assistant under Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula.</br><i>(Note: Not all the code snippets & results have been shared owing to lab regulations and NDAs pertaining to funded internship projects).</i> </br>      </br>  

            My core areas of work include the following: 
                          </br>  
                         1. Semantic segmentation, instance segmentation, classification, clustering and detection in medical imaging</br>
                          2. Steerable filters</br>
                          3. Indic script recognition(Kannada & Devanagari)</br>
                          4. Fast bilateral filters and bilateral edge detectors</br>
                          5. Transliteration of text from scene images (Kannada)</br>  </br></br><p>

               This was my first funded project in the biomedical sector. During the course of my internship, I was introduced to concepts of Deep Learning. I worked on classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and clustering 9 selected abnormalities present in wireless capsule endoscopy (WCE) images. My experiements took into account different colour spaces, data augmentation methods, patching and coupling traditional clustering algorithms with DNNs for joint unsupervised learning. We worked in collaboration with the Gastroenterology Department at Command Hospital Bangalore.</br><u>Additional Links</u>:<a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dzufhu2hEJ7sq7FQeXqaTSuA7QzAymKw?usp=sharing" style="color: #cd5c5c"> [Resources]</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_swnsCcJGMpOWlUbkI1enBueFlZVzdDb3FTZTRTbGFVTGJr/view?usp=sharing" style="color: #cd5c5c"> [Sample Update]</a> </br><font color="#A55858">Fun Fact: I managed to complete Andrew NG's deeplearning.ai specialization within the first month of my internship!</font></b></br></br></p>

                Initially, I implemented the algorithm on Fast Bilateral Filters using Fourier Kernels (this has a reasonable trade-off between image accuracy and computational time). Building on this algorithm, I designed a noise-robust and computationally efficient algorithm for fast bilateral edge detection using the concepts of steerability and bilateral edge dection. In span of 8 weeks, I designed two new algorithms based on fast bilateral edge detectors and steerable fast bilateral edge detectors. My algorithms have been used in a government funded project on sidewalk detection. </br><u>Additional Links</u>: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_swnsCcJGMpZy1EeHk4T21NTTJIRDNwNHFVMkUwWWxwR2N3/view?usp=sharing" style="color: #cd5c5c">[Seminar Report]</a> <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_swnsCcJGMpYzdmSFRMTVBhT1FOVVZ4M2d3TjJrLVNDV0RJ/view?usp=sharing" style="color: #cd5c5c">[Manipal Presentation]</a><font color="#A55858"></br><font color="#A55858">Fun Fact: I was orininally asked to make an Android app for steerable bilateral filtering.

                As a sophomore, I was lucky to get selected for an internship under Prof. KR Ramakrishnan. I designed a pre-processing algorithm for raw, textual scene images to suit the requirements of OCRs like Tesseract. Following this, I trained the Tesseract OCR separately, with combinations of various Kannada fonts for optimal recognition of the Kannada Script. I also tried my hand at convolutional neural networks for Kannada character recognition. Finally, I built an Android application that pre-processed the image and transliterated the textual content with the help of Tesseract tools for Android. I also used my pre-processing algorithm along with a PhD student's work on Kannada charater recognition. Our results(96.8%) surpassed the state of the art by almost 2%. </br><font color="#A55858">Fun Fact: This was the first time I had used OpenCV Android.

        </br>Hindi script is complex due to concavities, holes and curvatures. I evaluated several traditional and deep clustering techniques for Hindi numeral recognition. Subsequently, I modified the CNN modules in the recurrent framework in <i>Joint Unsupervised Learning (JULE) of Deep Representations and Image Clusters</i>. We obtained NMI values as high as 8.78 (surpassing pre-existing results). Additionally, I preprocessed images by de-noising and using contrast adjustment techniques.</br>  <font color="#75272D">Guide: Prof. Nisha Shetty </font></br>

          <p><b>Brochure Design using Emotion Detection and Neural Style Transfer</b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e3a4WgPyW0my3tqAaLMUmmD1mWDSOiY_/view?usp=sharing" style="color: #3366BB"> [Paper]</a></br>

        Although most corporates and private groups bank on various templates or human expertise for brochure designing, we wanted to automate the same. Based on a survey of 150 members, several textures from the DTD Data-set have been categorized based on the emotions they evoke. We train two emotion detection algorithms (based on ANNs and SVMs)  on the Twitter Data-set and use the results for predicting the emotion associated with the catalogue content. Following this, a plain content image and a corresponding emotionally relevant texture image are combined via image style transfer. Our idea is novel; we couple concepts of image style transfer with textual images, evaluate the textual emotion detection methodologies and present designed brochures in our paper. Our paper is under review. </br>

        As a sophomore, I was interested in studying different distributed data mining architectures. Hence, we worked on a review paper which included the GRID architecture, similarity based models and implementation in P2P Networks. In addition, I  learnt about Knowledge Grid Services and the Globus Toolkit. Lastly, the traditional warehousing model was compared to recent models. </br>  <font color="#75272D">Guides: Prof. Nisha Shetty & Prof. Balachandra Muniyal </font></br></br></p>

        To predict the occurence of landslides in different regions, we designed and evaluated classifier models like the Random Forest and Naive Bayes Classifiers. Our project required intensive data cleaning of raw data from NASA's Landslide Data-set. Following this, we visualised  and analysed trends in parameters like rainfall, temperature, area,  population etc. </br>
