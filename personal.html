        <h3 class="section__title" align="center" style="color:#753434">A Talk given by Me as a Fresher</h3>
        <div class="tab__container">
                
                <p>I spoke about the importance of team spirit in the Indian Airforce, as a fresher. Even today, I strongly believe that a collaboration adds to the idea pool, when it comes to any venture. As a part of 4 technical groups at Manipal, I have come to realise that team work is as important as independent effort. Here is a copy of my script.</p>


                <p>How do you define team-work? Simply put- it is togetherness; the ability of a group to think together and work together. As a reward, the output becomes productive; two and two can become five.</p>

                <p>For a moment, let me play devil’s advocate and construct a situation for you. One of the team members of the formation flight (in the poster/ slide) had a development at home the previous night which left him disturbed. The incident kept lingering in his mind. Next morning the weather was bright and the team took off for a practice flying session. Midway through an aerobatic exercise, the affected member’s mind drifted away from the intense cockpit environment and the plane went out of synchronisation with the formation. Can you imagine, what our loss could be?</p>

                <p>A few planes………Some pilots..……….  and, the confidence of the other pilots on their flying machines would have been shaken. But all is not lost.……. Do you know that, on the very next day of the accident, the formation commander (generally known as the Squadron Commander), would make it a point to fly a solo sortie all by himself, to restore the confidence of the team. Ladies & gentlemen, that is the kind of leadership that drives team building efforts in The Indian Air Force.</p>

                <p>Have you ever given a thought to how a small country like Israel maintains such a powerful identity although it is surrounded by so many big countries and communities, practising a different faith and culture? Just to give you a food for thought- Israel has one of the strongest Air Forces in the world. </p>

                <p>Have you ever given a thought to how a small country like Israel maintains such a powerful identity although it is surrounded by so many big countries and communities, practising a different faith and culture? Just to give you a food for thought- Israel has one of the strongest Air Forces in the world.</p>

                <p>Have you ever given a thought to how a small country like Israel maintains such a powerful identity although it is surrounded by so many big countries and communities, practising a different faith and culture? Just to give you a food for thought- Israel has one of the strongest Air Forces in the world. 7. Now let us focus on the practical working of Indian Air Force. This is where leadership and team-work take final shape. The first and foremost priority for Air Force is to keep the organisation ready to fight a war at all times. To make it possible, there has to be complete understanding and co-operation besides competence across the departments and the people in the organisation. Therefore, the senior leaders in the organisation ensure that individual opinions are respected and decisions are made in a democratic way. People engage in dialogues and meetings very frequently because that promotes openness and helps to maintain mutual trust and confidence. Trust and confidence is the hallmark of Air Force way of life; it comes on full display when the chief technician hands over an aircraft to a pilot for a mission with some good wish, Happy Landings, my Captain.</p>

                <p>Top leadership of the organisation firmly believes that ‘there has to be discipline on the ground if we have to maintain discipline in the air’. Officers are given to handle cross-functional responsibilities from an early age to strengthen their leadership skills. The organisation keeps its focus on group performance, by assigning tasks and targets, which would invariably call for inter-departmental planning, co-operation and execution. There is no denying that, individual contributions are recognised, but this is done with the sole objective of harnessing potentials. In short, I would say that it is discipline, hard work and togetherness that keeps up the motto of the organisation, “Touch the sky with glory”.</p>

                <p>I may go completely off the mark, if I do not showcase the Socio-cultural bonding of The Indian Air Force. Games and sports, cultural programmes and festivities are organised with great energy and participation. Each Air Force base behaves as one united family. There is so much of give and take. Irrespective of religion, all airmen and their families play Holi, attend Langar and welcome Santa Claus.  When husbands are out of station, other families extend full care and support. Wives of senior officers in the Air Base organise welfare activities for the families. Mind you, when an aircraft crashes, the entire Air Base will stand by the bereaved family, share its grief and do everything possible to normalise life.</p>

                <p>Ladies & gentlemen, the world is full of examples of successful team-work. I am choosing to go back to the 2nd World War for one of the finest examples. It was 6th of June, 1944. Within a few minutes past mid night, 24,000 troops from the Allied forces were air-dropped under the full moon along the North-Western coast of France to launch the initial assault. Subsequently, more and more troops were inducted, exceeding a million, by the time France was liberated from German occupation, 2 months later.  This operation is famously known as The Normandy Landings executed by British General Montgomery. It was a very well planned team-work of Allied Commanders which engaged 39 Army Divisions from 5 countries including America, Britain, Poland, Canada and France.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, I would say that Team-Work is a necessity in every sphere of our life. Sooner or later, all of us in this class will have to master the art of building and leading a team, to become successful professionals in our future days. (Thank You :P)</p>

        <div class="changelog__item">
          <div class="changelog__detail">
            <p>Working with Dr. Sanjay Singh was one of the most enriching experiences of my college life. Although our interactions were brief, he taught me the art of presenting a research paper. In  the beginning, I was asked to go through papers from a list of reputed Journals of Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Data Mining. After 3 weeks of scrutiny, I decided to work along the lines of a <b><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7933927" style="color: #cd5c5c">paper on Adscope</a></b>. Thereafter, I was asked to present the paper in a week. </p>

            <p>To give you a brief introduction about AdScope, let's understand the traditional process of analyzing data from a live search campaign. User queries that match campaign keywords, are sent from a service provider to an advertising expert.<b>The task of manually going through the queries to deem them relevant to the campaign, can be laborious.</b> Make note of the fact that relevant queries can imply potential customers or targets. To overcome the above-mentioned challenge, Ahmet Bulut et.al. designed a web-based interactive system called Adscope. It helps in assessing the relevance of a query to the ad campaign by using <b>relevance feedback</b> from users and advertisers, to rank queries.</p>

            <p>Most conferences provide approximately 15 minutes in presenting important aspects of one's paper. Since I was presenting an existing paper, I had to take references into account. Based on sir's 5 slide method, I systematically covered the <b>problem statement, previous work, recent work, critical analysis and future scope.</b> Based on his advice, I included a section themed <b>'why do I care'</b> or 'which aspects interest me'. The small details always matter. Little did I know that justifying interests would help me while drafting my SOP for a masters programme in CS. In conclusion, please feel free to refer to my slides <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_swnsCcJGMpbGp1R1B2NmNmUlh0Mi1hOFhsYUx6M0hYQ0Vn/view"  style="color: #cd5c5c">here</a></b>. </p>

        <h3 align="center">My First Hour-long Seminar at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc)</h3>
        <div class="tab__container">
             
        	<p>It's one thing give a lightning talk amongst 4000 developers,it's another thing to face a group of PhD students, research assistants and professors for an hour. Altogether a different ball game. Towards the end of my final year internship at IISc, I was asked to conduct a seminar within a week. I spoke about my project on classification, clustering, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy images. But was it important to conduct a seminar right after y internship? The motives behind this were plenty. </p>

          <p>To begin with, I wanted to gain insignts on plausible solutions to the challenges in the future scope of my work. To this end, I compiled a separate document detailing the suggestions by the audience. Several discussions with the PhD students made me realize that one of the challenges was rather benificial to my task. For example, a large number of benign image samples was not a problem; it could be leveraged for real-time classification of abnrmalities (since the system would encounter far more normal images in real-time). Secondly, the talk required a thorough understanding of underlying concepts, and challenged my presentation and teaching skills. Lastly, I had to organize my talk in order to present my owrk cogently.</p>

              <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/indiabuildsactions/" style="color: #cd5c5c" >Actions on Google campaign</a> across India soon after. The campaign was themed <b>'Solve for India'</b>. I was determined to contribute to this cause.</p>

        	<p>After going through several actions on my Google Assistant app, I observed how <b>non-profits were using them to raise awareness regarding social issues and educational ventures</b>. Meanwhile, a #SheBleeds blog article, by my childhood friend, on menstrual awareness popped up on my Facebook news feed. Let me fast forward by few months - it was a pleasant surprise to hear that an alumnus from my college had founded a non-profit called #SheBleeds. Their mission reasonated with my beliefs. After a series of discussions with the founder,Yash Mehrotra, <b>I  collaborated with the non-profit</b> to design the She Bleeds chatbot. Being associated with such an encouraging group is truly a delight! You can find out more about #SheBleeds <a href="http://www.shebleeds.in/about.html" style="color: #cd5c5c">here</a>.</p>

        	<p>But what is the initiative about? <b>#SheBleeds is advocating for a bill to be passed in the Indian legislature to grant menstrual leaves for women.</b> They aim at starting a dialogue on menstrual issues and address the period taboo in  India. Their recent efforts include distributing  100+ sanitary pads in rural areas of India and educating girls about menstrual hygiene. </p>

        <h3 align="center">Analysing the Domain Trends for Winter Projects at IECSE</h3>
        <div class="changelog__item">
          <div class="changelog__detail">
            <p>While serving as the Vice-chairperson of the Institute of Engineers Computer Science Engineering (IECSE) Manipal, I was intrigued by an unexpected trend in selecting domains for winter tasks. Approximately 100 students had to select a set of domains based on their skills and interests, and provide <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_swnsCcJGMpdm5DVV9kZ0lLWUU/view?usp=sharing" style="color: #cd5c5c">feedback</a> after the mentorship session. The domains comprised Application Development, Web Development, Design, Competitive Coding, and Research.<b> I observed a few students taking up an unexpected medley of domains</b> like competitive coding and design! Were these combinations influenced by individual interests or better domain mentors? </p>


            <p>Along with 2 other friends, I compared results obtained on performing frequent pattern mining with the sentiment analysis quotient on reviews given by mentees of different domains. The Apriori algorithm gave us 32 rules and we used the Naive Baye's classifier for sentiment analysis. Using these results, we <b>established relations between the technologies that were in demand, predicted domains with considerably low mentee satisfaction and studied the dependency of one domain on the other.</b> We also used a predictive model to <b>decide what a newcomer is  most likely to choose</b>, based on certain factors (features) like ‘having a start up’ and ‘having artistic skills’.</p>

            <figure>

                    <!--<figcaption align="middle">The OpenCV-android Download Page</figcaption>-->
                </figure>

            <p>Finding the logic fuzzy? Let me illustrate a simple example. Assume that several students take up research in cryptography and digital design. They finish their winter project and give excellent reviews. <b>If minimally related domains like (research, design) are frequently occuring with a positive feedback, the mentors must be good.</b> On the contrary, if students have taken related domians like (design, front-end web dev) and have provided negative reviews, the mentors must be incompetent. There is a lot of scope for future work, especially in cases where students have mixed reviews towards different domains. </p>

        <h3 class="section__title" align="center">An Online Attendance System</h3>
        <p>Towards the beginning of my junior year, I noticed that our professors were facing a challenge with the new <a href="https://slcm.manipal.edu/loginForm.aspx" style="color: #cd5c5c">Student Life Cycle Management System</a>. Besides noting down our attendance manually, they had to visit our online portal to mark the absentees. Our software design technology professor mentioned about how time-consuming the entire process was. With this in mind, <b>I wanted to work towards a simple solution to automate the updation process.</b></p>

        <figure>
                    <img src="Images/sdt2.png" class="responsive" align="middle"  width="900px"/>
                    <!--<figcaption align="middle">The OpenCV-android Download Page</figcaption>-->
                </figure>

        <p>On approaching our faculty with a proposition, we were told that manual entry into the attendance register was mandatory for college records. Therefore, <b>we decided to build a web application that could recognize characters, save the content as a text file and transfer the textual content to the college portal.</b> We split the task into two stages. Initially, the photo of the attendance register sheet would be preprocessed on an Android platform (using OpenCV Android). Subsequently, the preprocessed image would be uploaded a web application for optical character recognition. Tesseract.js was used for the latter, and HTML5 and CSS was used to develop the front-end of the website. To run JSP pages on our website, we used the Apache Tomcat web server.  </p> 

        <p>My contributions include building an Android application for image enhancement. This involved de-noising, skew correction, thresholding and morphological operations like dilation. I also trained the Tesseract OCR for nearly 17 iterations, in order to recognize multiple English fonts. My team consisted of Vignesh and Anshul. Our guide, Prof. Sucheta Kolekar, proposed a deparmental collaboration :)</p>
