                <p><i>The following story encompasses the life and maniacal behavior (paranoia) of a disturbed and pregnant
                  widow who has poisoned her husband. The various aspects of life, including ‘life’ itself- has been
                  personified for emphasis and imagery. Although their relationship was marked by Molly getting thrashed by
                  her husband, this story highlights the everlasting love that she holds for him. She cannot come to terms
                  with his death due to which she spirals into a series of delusions- almost like a domino effect! Also, the
                  setting is synonymous with her mood. She dreams of her husband, which reflects her state of mind.
                  There is a striking contrast between what she wants and the crude reality. Her dream highlights the fact
                  that she regrets all the happenings and wishes to be victimized by death, rather than having her
                  husband taken away. Dialogues have been repeated deliberately.</i></p>
                

                <p>Beep-beep-beep. The cardiogram beeped into a flat line. Doctors rushed in and scurried like
                white mice while nurses got the apparatus ready for defibrillation, amidst all the chaos. “I’m sorry Mr.
                Philips, we couldn’t save your wife”. His head was throbbing on the remnants of the jarring beeps,
                intensifying every second, into a monstrous migrane. The sudden turn of events were psychologically
                traumatic and devastating, an awkward silence persisted- resembling the kind of tense quietude one
                experiences in a closed examination hall or seconds before a sealed vacuum container is about to
                explode. A newly-stitched bloody cut scarred her left wrist prominently-a sign of both despair and
                helplessness. Precisely one and a quarter hours ago, the very same gash was a gateway via which a
                surge of viscous crimson had gushed out to form a red pool beside her sofa. Consequence- COMATOSE.</p>

                      <p>“Chr..Christ! Wake up Molly-I need you damnnit!”, echoed through the walls of the ICU.
                      “WAKE UP!” He was being victimized to the gazillion piercing ‘Why’s’ and ‘How’s’ that his mind was
                      darting at him, at once. He smiled like a maniacal beast as his mind played fowl-no, she was alive.
                      Delusion and Realization were tugging (at whatever remained of) him on either sides, while Death
                      dominantly devoured a huge chunk of him from the insides, causing an irreplaceable void. And then it
                      dawned on him that she was gone. Hope was his only companion. “I’m sorry babe”, were the only words
                      that he could voice out as he rose up to leave.</p>

                      <p>A faint ‘Grrrrrr’ startled Molly as she rubbed her drooping eyelids. It must have been a faint buzz
                      of the oxygen cylinder in the hospital room. The lights were probably turned off because it was too late.
                      She was both, tired and drugged. “Sweetie, you there?....John?”, but she heard no replies. She
                      straightened herself as her eyes absorbed every bit of her surroundings- an old lamp, highlights of her
                      settee, a crystal chandelier and an ornate vase. “Stop it Victor!Shhh-Bad Boy!“. Realization had slapped
                      her harder the second time, for she was at home. Whoosh! He was gone. She asked herself repeatedly
                      where John could be. And then she knew it, almost intuitively. With a sudden unleashed vigor, she
                      bathed in an exotic pool of water mixed with lavender body wash and aromatic jasmine oil. Enigma and
                      Insanity had collaborated on a devious plot to stop her from meeting Closure. Once again, Hope
                      predominated.</p> </br>

                      <p>At 2 A.M, the Catholic Cemetery was blanketed by a morose and desolate atmosphere, highlighted by
                      blacks and greys. An eerie, life-less silence prevailed through the tombstone- studded area. Bare tree
                      trunks, gigantic white Crosses, leeched soil and not a single cricket- it was like a page pulled out of a
                      macabre! She heard the shrill cry of a hyena as a strong gust of biting wind made all her attempts at lighting her lantern futile, in a single blow. She sat beside the huge tombstone, caressing the scars which
                      were all over her torso.</p>

                      <p>A hot tear drop trickled down her cold pale cheek, and her hands ran down to her baby bump
                      almost instinctively. “John..I know you’re here WAKE UP, please-I need you! L..Look, we could work
                      things out”. What made sense to her seemed bizarre to the others. Death was out of her reach- she had
                      to live, for what she was cradling in her womb-Life. Insanity had seized her better half 4 months back,
                      when she had poisoned John’s glass of champagne on their 2nd anniversary. But something very different
                      happened tonight. ”I…I’m so sorry John”. Molly wept like a baby as Realization had struck her hard
                      another time. Hope was her only companion and God Father to her child.</p>

                <p>4 years later- Hope Philips woke up with a jolt, in her foster home.</p>
