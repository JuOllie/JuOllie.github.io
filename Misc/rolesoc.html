                <p>A role model serves as an example of values, attitudes and behaviours that can be emulated by others. Role models can influence the choice of careers and areas of study for students. There can be community role models like teachers and parents. These days, media’s frequent invasion into popular culture has converged attention to celebrities from the world of sports or films, who are being chosen as role models. According to me, certain characteristics of a society can be understood by studying the choice of role models.</p>

                <p>Let’s take a look at Singapore, a highly developed economy with 3rd highest per capita GDP in the world. <b>It is one of the least corrupt countries and recognised as most pro-business.</b> The rate of unemployment is just around 2%. The citizens of Singapore look up to Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister of this country. He ruled for 3 decades and transitioned Singapore from the 3rd world to the 1st world. <b>He believed in meritocracy, a non-corrupt government and civil service. He upheld sound work ethics and enforced discipline in civil life. He also engaged in long-term economic and social planning, and encouraged entrepreneurship. </b>His qualities refect on the progress of the country and work ethics of the citizens.</p>

                <p>As the supreme commander, George Washington led the patriotic forces (the Continental Army) to victory against the British in the American Revolutionary War during 1975-83 (for eight and a half years). He was the hero of the revolution and presided  at the constitutional convention of 1787 which established the new federal Government. One of the founding fathers of the United States of America, George Washington is considered an international icon for liberation and nationalism. He possessed remarkable qualities like <b>integrity, self-discipline, courage, honesty, resolve, decision, forbearance, decency, religious tolerance and respect for others. </b>Additionally, he had a strong achiever’s instinct. These qualities are observed in several American societies.</p>


                <p>If you look at the start-up culture in Silicon Valley, you might observe how Bill Gate's values and traits reasonate with the youth. Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, is famous for his <b>humanitarian causes</b>. He was a <b>child prodigy</b>. Along with Melinda Gates, he strongly <b>supports diversity and equal opportunity</b>. He was certainly among the <b>risk takers</b> (the fact that he dropped out of Harvard is reason enough). </b></p>

                <p>India is known for <b>'unity in diversity'</b>. It has over 720 dialects and a rich culture heritage. Moreover, Indians are amiable and fun-loving. Mahatma Gandhi, the Father of our nation, is a role model for many citizens. He <b>believed in ahimsa (non-violence)</b> and  was against any radicalism or aggression even during our War for Independence. Many Indian societies follow his societal ideals. </p>

                <p>Role models do influence societies. Thus, we can conclude that the choice of role models speaks multitudes about the people in the corresponding societies.</p>
