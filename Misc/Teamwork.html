                <p>I spoke about the importance of team spirit in the Indian Airforce, as a fresher. Even today, I strongly believe that collaboration adds to the idea pool, when it comes to any venture. As a part of 4 technical groups at Manipal, I have come to realise that team work is as important as independent effort. The script was compiled after several discussions with my father (a retired Airforce office). I'm very grateful to him &hearts; Hope you enjoy the read (note that this may sound a little colloquial).</p>

              </br>
                <p> Let me take you straight to the blue skies with my motivation (pointing to the photo) depicting <b style="color:#A05654">'Glorious Togetherness'</b>. That’s a picture- perfect aerobatic manoeuvre of an Indian Air Force formation flight. So today, I am going to talk about <b>teamwork in the Indian Air Force.</b></p>

                <p>How do you define teamwork? Simply put- it is togetherness; the ability of a group to think together and work together. As a reward, the output becomes productive; <i>two and two can become five.</i></p>

                <p>For a moment, let me play devil’s advocate and construct a situation for you. One of the team members of the formation flight (in the photo) had a development at home the previous night which left him disturbed. The incident kept lingering in his mind. Next morning the weather was bright and the team took off for a practice flying session. Midway through an aerobatic exercise, the affected member’s mind drifted away from the intense cockpit environment and the plane went out of synchronisation with the formation. Can you imagine, what our loss could be?</p>

                <p>A few planes...some pilots...and, the confidence of the other pilots on their flying machines would have been shaken. But all is not lost. <b>Do you know that, on the very next day of the accident, the formation commander (generally known as the Squadron Commander) would make it a point to fly a solo sortie all by himself, to restore the confidence of the team?</b> Ladies & gentlemen, that is the kind of leadership that drives team building efforts in The Indian Air Force.</p>

                <p>Have you ever given a thought to how a small country like Israel maintains such a powerful identity although it is surrounded by so many big countries and communities, practising different faiths and cultures? Just to give you food for thought- Israel has one of the strongest Air Forces in the world. </p>
                <p>The process of team building in our Air Force starts right from the point of recruitment. The process of selection is elaborate and scientific, aimed at a thorough mapping of candidates’ aptitude for thinking positive, solving problems and assuming leadership.  The training and induction process is spread over almost 18 months. During this period, the new entrants are aligned with the military philosophy and culture. They are engaged in rigorous group activities and competitions. <b>You will be surprised to know that no Air Force pilot graduates through the Training Academy without having taken a couple of blows, punches and choicest slangs from their instructors inside the cockpit. However, on such days, hard feelings do not last long. Because, the instructor calls his trainee pilot over to his house for a cup of coffee with the family to wash away the wounds! So, the mentoring style is, be ruthless while in business, otherwise be the best brother around. </b></p>

                <p>Now let us focus on the practical working of the Indian Air Force. This is where leadership and teamwork take final shape. The first and foremost priority for Air Force is to keep the organisation ready to fight a war at all times. To make it possible, there has to be complete understanding and co-operation besides competence across the departments and the people in the organisation. Therefore, the senior leaders in the organisation ensure that individual opinions are respected and decisions are made in a democratic way. People engage in dialogues and meetings very frequently because that promotes openness and helps to maintain mutual trust and confidence. Trust and confidence is the hallmark of Air Force way of life; it comes on full display when the chief technician hands over an aircraft to a pilot for a mission with some good wishes, "Happy landings, my Captain".</p>

                <p>Top leadership of the organisation firmly believes that, <b style="color:#A05654">‘there has to be discipline on the ground if we have to maintain discipline in the air’</b>. Officers are given to handle cross-functional responsibilities from an early age to strengthen their leadership skills. The organisation keeps its focus on group performance, by assigning tasks and targets, which would invariably call for inter-departmental planning, co-operation and execution. There is no denying that individual contributions are recognised, but this is done with the sole objective of harnessing potentials. In short, I would say that it is discipline, hard work and togetherness that keeps up the motto of the organisation, <b style="color:#A05654">'Touch the sky with glory'</b>.</p>

                <p>I may go completely off the mark, if I do not showcase the <b>socio-cultural bonding of The Indian Air Force</b>. Games, sports, cultural programmes and festivities are organised with great energy and participation. Each Air Force base behaves as one united family. There is so much of give and take. Irrespective of religion, all airmen and their families play Holi, attend Langar and welcome Santa Claus.  When husbands are out of station, other families extend full care and support. Wives of senior officers in the Air Base organise welfare activities for the families. <b>Mind you, when an aircraft crashes, the entire Air Base will stand by the bereaved family, share its grief and do everything possible to normalise life.</b></p>

                <p>Ladies & gentlemen, the world is full of examples of successful teamwork. I am choosing to go back to the 2nd World War for one of the finest examples. It was 6th of June, 1944. Within a few minutes past mid night, 24,000 troops from the Allied forces were air-dropped under the full moon along the North-Western coast of France to launch the initial assault. Subsequently, more and more troops were inducted, exceeding a million, by the time France was liberated from German occupation, 2 months later.  This operation is famously known as <b>The Normandy Landings</b> executed by British General Montgomery. It was a very well planned teamwork of Allied Commanders which engaged 39 Army Divisions from 5 countries including America, Britain, Poland, Canada and France.</p>

                <p>In conclusion, I would say that team-work is a necessity in every sphere of our life. Sooner or later, all of us in this class will have to master the art of building and leading a team, to become successful professionals in our future days. Thank You :)</p>
