               <p><i> The Bhagvad Gita is the religious book of the Hindus. This article needs certain background knowledge (apologies for the jargon).</i> </p>

                <p>Atma is described as “sprit” or “soul” in layman’s terms. But what is it? Is there really a precise definition or description of it? It is something that was, is and will always continue to be? According to the Gita, the ‘atman’ is described using various epithets :- everlasting, eternal, unborn, immeasurable, imperishable , ancient, immutable, unchangeable, stable and all-pervading. Based on the Gita, <b>that which is- will always be (i.e. it will never cease to exist) , whereas that which never was, will never be</b>. We can compare this to the ‘living’ and the ‘non-living’.</p>

                  <p>But what is life? What is the meaning of the term ‘living’? </p>

                  <p>Taking man as a general example, on a superficial level, we tend to associate ‘life’ with our ‘mortal body’. Two aspects or components exist in this context. But again, what is the proof to this? Probably intuition. Not everything has a logical reason afterall.</p> 


                      <p>‘WE’ comprise our <b>mortal form and an immortal Being</b> that resides within this physical form.</p>

                      <p>We can sense, feel, perceive and be sensitive to our surroundings because of this mortal form. But our body  is a temporary abode for our soul. It is synonymous with an inn, the soul serving as a mere traveller. Gandhi ,in his interpretation of the Gita, compared the physical form/body to one’s clothes which are  cast-off and shed when they get worn out, following which new clothes are worn. Similarly ,the soul moves on from one body (worn out) to another (new).Each one of us has a soul. It is referred to as the ‘BEING’ in the Gita. Our soul is what actually lives. But does this soul evolve?</p>

                <p>Rightfully said, nothing can harm or affect this ‘Being’. Neither can water destroy it ,nor can fire burn it. It remains untouched. All of us have a soul which is believed to manifest and unite into a bigger ‘Being’-the ‘Universal Being ‘ or God. This theory has also been put forth by Dr.Brian Wiess( a psychiatrist) in his novel- Many Lives Many Masters. He speaks of reincarnation and the various  levels to which our souls evolve. According to him, the soul is sent to this earth on a journey-a purpose every life, from which it learns and gains knowledge to evolve to a higher level. The Supreme level is what we call ‘God’. Hence people say that God exists in us and he is omnipotent. Each of our souls is a small part of a bigger ocean. Even the Gita refers to our soul as ‘Him’ because we are a part of a greater Being which is incomprehensible and unfathomable.</p>

                <p>Rhonda Bryne takes mention of our ‘inner-self’ in ‘The Secret’, talking about the <b>Law of attraction</b> and how all of us can tune to a particular frequency of thought where we are in communion and can communicate to the universe. </p>

                <p>According to me ,the only valid proof about all this is  our intuition, conscience or what we call a 'gut-feeling'. We believe in what we choose to believe.</p>

                <p>Krishna tries to convince Arjun that he cannot be a slayer because <b>one’s soul cannot be harmed in any way</b>. Even if he chooses to take the lives of so many people, some being his very own, he can never destroy their souls. He may kill their bodily forms but their existence will not cease. The ‘atman’ cannot be slayed by any means. Therefore, he requests Arjun not to be ignorant and to refrain from grieving for anyone. He must not regret that which is unavoidable or inevitable.</p>

                <p>Irrespective of the alternate interpretations, there is no concrete definition of 'Atma'. </p>
