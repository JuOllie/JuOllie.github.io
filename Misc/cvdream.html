                <p>Aimed at mimicking human visual systems, Computer Vision gained popularity as an interdisciplinary domain to bolster intelligent systems in understanding the real world, visually. With the goal of automating tasks pertaining to human visual perception, AI enthusiasts are working at understanding the full, 3 dimensional scene. I foresee AI coupled with CV to be a transformational game changer, <b>revolutionising the way in which a machine interprets visual data surpassing human agility</b>. From Larry Robert’s Thesis, ’Machine perception of 3-D solids’, to a new image database by Stanford AI Lab-‘Visual Genome’, engineers are working at integrating the comprehension of the 3D world and associated visual semantics to link visual perception to cognition. Modern era science has embraced the concepts of Computer Vision for wider application, in both academia and the industry. Healthcare, robotics, media, marketing, AR, VR, fashion, farming, security and photography are some of them.</p>

                <p>Disney animated movies have intrigued me since my childhood days; as a student, my ‘extra- activity’ classes were spent in introspecting how accurate voice syncing was possible in animated movies and how 2D sketches could lead to such fluid movements. As a consequence, I started appreciating aspects of motion, with vision. With the release of Ratatouille, the idea of <b>imagineering</b> fuelled my passion of wanting to delve deeper into the concepts supporting such an ideology. As an image processing enthusiast in my freshman year, I took it upon myself to self-learn a domain that was not in the scope of my undergraduate curriculum. Towards the end of my sophomore year at college, I was offered an internship to work on <b>‘Transliteration of Kannada Text in a Camera Captured Scene Image on an Android Platform’</b> at IISc. My first internship under Prof. KR Ramakrishnan, was an eye-opener to realising that we’re heading towards an AI powered future. I had a latent desire to add a ‘learning’ aspect to my image processing ventures so that I could bridge my knowledge-base to building AI based cognitive solutions. With this background, I opted for a Machine Learning minor at college.</p>

                <p>I worked on a project termed, ‘Steerable Fast Bilateral Edge Detectors’ as a part of my internship at IISc, in 2017. During the course of my internship, I developed two new algorithms namely- <b>fast bilateral edge detection and steerable fast bilateral edge detection</b>. The bilateral filter can be modified to an edge detector, on modifying the Gaussian domain and range kernels. Although several techniques have been used to obtain computationally fast bilateral filters, I worked on an algorithm having a reasonable trade-off between image accuracy and computational time. Thereafter, the concepts of fast bilateral filters had been coupled with bilateral edge detectors to design a fast bilateral edge detector. My noise-robust and computationally efficient algorithm for steerable fast bilateral edge detection was based on fast bilateral filtering using Fourier kernels. Simulation results along with the peak signal to noise ratio for various noisy and noise-free gray-scale images were presented by me. The algorithms were aimed at sidewalk edge detection.</p>

                <p>As an overview, the fast bilateral edge detector was obtained by <b>using a Laplacian filter as the spatial kernel and an inverted Gaussian range kernel to the Fast algorithm proposed in [2]</b>. In order to design the steerable fast bilateral edge detection algorithm, I used a steerable Gaussian kernel as the spatial kernel. This was achieved by rotating the first derivative of the Gaussian Kernel by 0 degree and 90 degree. Following this, <b>the Gaussian range kernel in the Fast Bilateral Filtering Algorithm is inverted to highlight pixel dissimilarity.</b> The concept of the Fast Algorithm by approximating via Fourier Kernels, has been adopted from [3] I aim at implementing the algorithm in real-time by a parallelised approach and my work can be extended in detecting edges of medical instruments near tumours, drone navigation, submarines, robot locomotion and other applications focussing at real-time edge detection.</p>

                <p>In my senior year, I worked on <b>classification, semantic segmentation, instance segmentation and clustering of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy images</b>, at IISc. We collaborated with the Command Hospital Airforce, Bangalore. The internship was a turning point because I got a chance to explore applications of CV in biomedical imaging. Regular visits to the hospital and discussions with different doctors made me realise the need for context-sensitive medical decision-making support systems to assist doctors. For example, the doctors found it difficult to distinguish between Cancer and polyps without abnormality depth information. In such a scenario, a decision-making system could support whem without any invasive form of imaging or biopsy. Although I was working with gastroenterologists, I had a chance to visit the neurology department where I learnt about functional neuroimaging, the grey area between psychaitry and neuroscience, and more importantly, the astounding number of mental trauma cases of soldiers guarding our borders.</p>

                <p>My constant brainstorming over problems of mathematics and physics in my high school days placed me firmly on the path of the conviction that, <b>“if you change the way you look at things, the things you look at will change”</b>. Meaning hereby, possibilities (solutions) do exist and, one has to scratch the layers in different ways and invent the gateways to these possibilities. This realisation, as a matter of fact, came about from my relentless pursuit of self learning. My natural thought process is like an intense journey asking myself why, how and what’s relevant. Thus far, it has helped me rise above complexities to form my perspectives and get a quick grasp of the subject matter. I love to launch new ideas and express myself at length. I love to provide leadership and be a frontrunner in actions too. I have developed the art of correlating concepts and integrating them to build concise solutions. 

                <p>I have been extremely fortunate to work under professors like Prof. Chandra Sekhar Seelamantula and Prof. K.R Ramakrishnan. I look forward to contributing to the state of the art in Computer Vision some day :)</p></br>
