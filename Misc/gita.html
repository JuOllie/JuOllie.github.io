                <p><i>The Bhagvad Gita is the religious book of the Hindus. This article needs certain background knowledge (apologies for the jargon). It covers an aspect of Krishna's advice to Arjun.</i></p>

                <p>The Gita clearly underscores the importance of letting go of one's ego. We tend to
                think of ourselves before anything else. We give our thoughts, emotions and aims the highest
                priority in our lives. This leads to dominance, rivalry, rudeness, meanness, distinction, jealousy, loftiness
                etc. Both egoists and egotists harm themselves in the long run.</p>

                  <p>Ego is a person’s sense of self-identity, self–consciousness, self-respect and image in society. An egoist
                  cares solely about his/her image and doesn’t pay any heed to others’ point of view or their feelings.</p>

                  <p>In the Gita, Arjun is not compared to an egoist at all. On the contrary, Krishna explains to him that if one
                  is facing any sort of a problem, <b>one should let go of any ego or attachment and look at the situation
                  from a very neutral perspective</b> as this would solve things without any judgmental bias.</p> 


                      <p>The best suited example to this, according to me, is the ambiguity in Arjun’s mind about one’s kinsmen.
                The fact that he did not want to harm Bhisma and Drona brings forth both justice and injustice when
                viewed from different perspectives. Then how is one to decide what to do in such situations? Take the side of one’s own blood relations or Dharma?</p>

                      <p>How does ego fit into the picture? The key answer lies in Arjun’s attitude of partiality. Bhisma
                and Drona belonged to the opponent’s side although the former was like his father while the latter was
                his Guru. He gave into wrong ways and stereotypical opinions of the society and that was precisely his
                weakness. The society would have found it preposterous and absurd to kill one’s very own. <b>The fact
                that Arjun thought of ‘HIS’ people, before thinking of the other lives that he would be taking while
                waging the war, is in itself an implication of ‘ego’ where he places something that he is attached to i.e. his
                people, before Dharma.</b></p>

                <p>If we look at the scenario from a detached observer’s perspective- we realize that any sense of
                attachment leads to bias decisions and prejudice. Is is Arjun’s fault? No, <b>this is a human tendency.</b>
                A detached person would never have viewed the ‘Kauravas’ as his/her brother and would therefore
                make a clear cut decision only based on dharma and adharma without any worldly intervention.
                Rightfully, Arjun should have been ready to kill Drona and Bhishma without hesitation, which he failed
                to do.</p>

                <p>Bhishma or Drona may not have been at fault individually, but they joined the opposing side which
                made them rivals. There can never be any alterations, compromises or exceptions to Dharma for Dharma
                is the ultimate truth.</p>

                <p>Being a Kshatriya warrior himself , Arjun never had any issues with fighting. He had an issue with the
                people who had challenged him. Isn’t violating both, non-violence and ahimsa, a kind of adharma in itself?</p>

                <p>According to me, at that time caste was a mere excuse for dominancy. It was probably made to maintain
                guilds, family lines of expertise and a harmony or balance between people of various occupational fields
                and colours of life. He was a warrior by birth, but did that give him the right to kill? That question has
                not been raised at all. Instead, he is dropped into a no-win situation and is checkmated. He has to
                fight-for if he flees,it will result in the annihilation of the small Pandava clan. <b>The best thing to do in such
                a situation is to forget any personal ties and treat all enemies alike.</b></p>
