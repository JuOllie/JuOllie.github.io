                <p><i><b>“Deception is a virtuous art when it comes to war”</b></i>, is the message that gets driven sharply in our minds as Jack Higgins does a final unfolding of a secret in the concluding lines of this spy craft story of German adventure. The story, set in the backdrop of the Second world War, keeps one on the edge from the word go to the very end. So powerful is the narration and so adeptly are the characters plotted, that fiction never seems far from the truth. First published in 1975, it has sold over 50 million copies ever since. </p>

                      <p> Around mid September 1943, following Mussolini’s rescue from enemy captivity through a commando coup, Adolf Hitler called for a meeting to discuss future strategies at his Eastern Front Head Quarters in East Prussia. Among those who attended were his Minister of Propaganda, Minister for Total War, Chief of State Secret Police (Himmler) and The SS Chief of Military Intelligence (Admiral Canaris) , besides Mussolini. The Allied Forces had slowly begun turning the tide of the war on the Axis Forces  in those days. Odds notwithstanding, ‘Fuhrer’ still insisted nothing but total victory. As a strategic move, he demanded that Churchill be captured and brought out of England through a commando operation. He assigned this task, equated to bringing the devil from hell, to Admiral Canaris. His agent in England, Mrs. Joana Grey, operating from Nor wick (close to the coast), provided vital information in coded radio messages, that Winston Churchill was scheduled to spend the weekend at the home of Sir Henry Willoughby, Studley Grange, which was just 5 miles outside the village of Studley Constable. Sir Henry,a retired Naval Commander, was unable to resist confiding this information to Mrs. Grey, his friend.</p>

                      <p> 'The Eagle Has Landed' revolves around Lieutenant Colonel Kurt  Steiner, only  son of the Major General of Artillery- Karl Steiner(German), born in 1916.His mother was American. He had served in Poland, Narvik Norwegian Campaign, Belgium, Greece and finally Crete, severely wounded in savage fighting of the Winter War in Leningrad. He was court-martialled. Steiner, along with his 30 survivors, are recruited as a penal unit by Radl, to work on a suicide operation-‘Sword Fish’, which involves kidnapping Churchill.</p> 


                      <p>Jack Higgins narrates the tactics, plots and challenges that the army and the individuals have to face in a <i>game of intellect vs daredevilry, valour vs humility, secrecy vs betrayal, physical strength vs character , precision, heroism, deception, planning and timing.</i> <b>On November 6th 1943,the German State of Chief Police receives a message-"The Eagle Has Landed” implying the landing of Steiner, along with his group of German paratroopers.</b> On this very same day, the paratroopers exhibit that they are <b>‘gentlemen first and soldiers next’</b>. Whether Steiner is successful at his mission or not, is for the readers to decide! </p>
