              </br>
                <p> Good afternoon ladies and gentlemen.</p>

                <p>Democracy by definition is a <b>government of the people, by the people and for the people.</b> That is to say, citizens of the country elect their representatives to form the government. And the government in turn, takes care of the citizens.</p>

                <p>The choice of representatives is a very significant factor in a democratic set up. The elected representatives are given the right to speak on behalf of their constituencies; they get the right to take decisions on behalf of their electors. This right can be treated as a privilege as well as a source of power.</p>

                <p>But the problem arises when this <b>power is misused and welfare of the majority is bypassed</b>. The problem becomes even bigger when this power is misused to orchestrate dictatorial designs. Indian democracy will never forget the year 1975, when a National Emergency was declared by Mrs. Indira Gandhi. Many of the vital democratic institutions of the country like the judiciary and the press lost their independence and were ruthlessly used by the political party in power to silence the voice of the opposition. Therefore, democracy which is considered as the best form of governance, can actually reduce to, <b style="color:#A05654">'Government off the people, buy the people and far the people'</b>.</p>

                <p>Ladies and gentlemen, the question therefore, is about making a choice as to who should be your representative. And mind you, each individual’s choice has the same importance in the eyes of our constitution. That is to say, each vote casted has the same value. There is no discrimination between the rich and the poor, or a Hindu and a Christian, or between a farmer and an industrialist. Therefore, each and every citizen has to think wisely in choosing his or her candidate in an election. We must not forget the immense sacrifices our freedom fighters made to give us an independent India and a constitution of our own. Today, we have the constitutional right to vote. If we do not exercise this right thoughtfully, our very own representatives can take us for granted and the ultimate consequence could even be the disintegration of the nation.</p>

                <p>So far I have repeatedly emphasised that citizens must apply their minds and make a decision regarding their choice of candidates. But what will give them the power to think? Which way will the empowerment happen?...<b>Education is enlightenment and literacy is the gateway to education.</b> Therefore, the answer is, give the people the ability to read and write; make them literate. Then only will the people be able to differentiate between the good, the bad and the ugly.</p>

                <p>In today’s context, the issues that draw attention are many.  One just needs to witness the kind of political discourse that happens inside the parliament houses and the state legislatures these days. It is more noise and less of insightful, constructive and healthy debates and discussions. Often, what comes on display are narrow considerations on the basis of caste, creed and religion, greed, parochialism, populism, empty sound bytes and violent gestures. We do hear what George Bernard Shaw had said, <b style="color:#A05654">"Politics is the last refuge of the scoundrels"</b>. It could be more true, if I said, <b style="color:#A05654">“Politics is the FIRST refuge of the scoundrels”</b>.</p>

                <p>India is a land of diversity. The builders of our nation thought that democracy was the best form of government to uphold unity alongside diversity.  There is bound to be multiplicity of thoughts and opinions because of the diverse nature of our population. However, this huge population of our country can bind itself to the larger cause of unity and nationalism only if the people can open up their minds, see reason and visualize the larger picture. They should not fall prey to the short-sighted evil designs of those ill-minded politicians who just want to somehow influence the unsuspecting minds of the people and exploit the situation. Education alone can broaden our horizon and keep the bad influences away from public life.</p>

                <p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have yet another problem in hand. What happens when we have too much of information as against very little information that was available 50 years ago? I call this the <b>problem of plenty</b>. The print media, the electronic and visual media, the internet, TV programmes, pre-poll surveys, etc. All of these can play havoc in the minds of the people and distort reality if they are not well educated to  apply discretion. We have to guard ourselves against paid news, rumour mongering, false promises and propaganda.</p>

                <p>Before I conclude, I want to say that the <b>overall literacy percentage of our population as of 2014 stands at 74% even after 67 years of independence.</b> Can we take pride in the fact that in the same period Japan, which reconstructed itself from the damages of 2nd world War, has a literacy rate of 99%? And, in terms of GDP (Gross Domestic Product), it is the 3rd among all the countries of the world. To end my talk, I must say that <b>education is a powerful means to good governance as well as good economy and quality of life.</b> Thank You :)</p>
