                <p> <b style="color:#a05654">"Power tends to corrupt and absolute power corrupts absolutely"</b>, said British statesman, Lord Acton. This quote implies that when rulers accumulate excessive unchecked power, they may lose morality. They are likely to exploit the situation and neglect the welfare of the people being ruled. In a scenario where people are suppressed and not allowed to ask questions for a long time, the situation may explode, <b>people may revolt</b>. It would be  like a pressure cooker relief valve that failed to function. An act of questioning should not be  viewed by the authorities as undermining or flouting the authority. Such transactions are to be valued as <b>constructive dialogues</b>, only then will the benefits reach both the sides. Those being ruled will no longer feel like outsiders within the collective and will engage in liberal exchange of ideas. </p>

                <p>Human beings are not infallible. Hence, the authorities inside a system may not always be more right in their thinking than the collective wisdom of the people placed under them. <b>Collective wisdom</b>, therefore, needs to be voiced. Modern history has taught us that the democratic form of governance is the preferred choice of the masses. Let us consider India, the largest democracy of the world, standing on the 3 pillars of the Union Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary. The executive (i.e. the Council of ministers) is accountable to the Legislature comprising the two houses (Lower House and the Upper House). Members of both the houses discuss at length the actions of the ruling dispensation and are free to question its decisions. This arrangement ensures  healthy governance of the country.</p>

                <p>Most high school students are taught about the European Renaissance or the Revival movement pertaining to the period 14th to 16th century AD which started in Italy and spread northwards to the rest of the continent. This period was marked by <b>a spirit of enquiry</b> across various fields like arts, science, literature, religion, and so on. <b>People steadfastly held on to their right to question irrational beliefs and wrong actions even at the cost of personal life and safety</b> (Galileo and Copernicus are two such examples). Consequently, what ensued was a period of enlightenment, progressive thinking and better quality of life.</p>

                <p>The consistent high GDP growth of India for the last 10 years is attributed to the landmark economic reforms of 1991 that embraced liberalisation and globalisation. But such reforms came about only after <b>persistent questioning and harsh criticism  of the economic policies of our government</b> by Indian economists and professors of economy in the universities. </p>

                <p>When individuals question authority, they speak up for themselves and expose wrongdoings. The #MeToo Movement serves as a good example in this regard. It is aimed at putting an end to exploitation and a misogynistic mindset at workplace. This will ensure equality of status, dignity and opportunity for women. With Tanushree Dutta's case, there has been an uproar in India. Victims have spoken about harassment, assault and implicit bias across different fields- starting from Bollywood to Journalism. The movement took a concrete form because one such individual had the courage to stand up for herself by questioning the norms.  </b></p>

                <p>What is your say? :)</p>
