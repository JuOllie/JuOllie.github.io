                <p> Back in 2015, Women Who Code and Pluralsight published a <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/content/dam/pluralsight/pdfs/landing-pages/b2c/Women_In_Tech.pdf" style="color: #cd5c5c">study</a> on the <b>need for more female role models</b> at work, especially in STEM careers. During this time, I served as a lead at Women Techmakers (WTM) Manipal. A similar trend among the female students at my college startled me. There were female tech enthusiasts at college who worked on impactful projects, bagged excellent internships, won several technical events and scholarships. Ironically, we did not know or talk about each other. This got me thinking.</br>  </br> 

                Over several discussions with the current Women Techmakers Leads, we thought of solutions anologous with WWC's #ApplaudHer initiative. As the first step, we built a website to highlight the achievements of female engineers at college. We had to consider the reception of such an initiative. How could we instill higher sense of awareness?</br>  </br> 
                 <figure>

                </figure>

                <p>Via a website, we underscored the achievements of our seniors, peers and juniors. <b>This encouraged our freshers to explore different opportunities like the GHCI scholarship. Furthermore, the bench-mark set by our seniors helped in self assessment. Social media and contact links were shared to enable networking amongst alumni and current students</b>. Lastly, we added a personal touch to the descriptions so that we could highlight non-technical skills too.  

                Wondering about how this was received? Male allies like Mayank contributed to <b><a href="https://github.com/Women-Techmakers-Manipal/Women-Techmakers-Manipal.github.io" style="color: #cd5c5c">our repository</a></b> and the project is open source for our juniors to contribute. Preetham Sir, our technical director of academics, shared our website on his Facebook wall :) Our team consists of Varuni, Harshini and I.

            <p>A quote from one of the speakers at the GHCI Google & Women Techmakers dinner, resonates with my motivation to pursue this project. She said,<b>"Your work will never speak for itself"</b>. True to its essence, this implies the importance of self-branding- whether it is a personal initiave or one's business venture. With this intent, I built a website for the ACM Women Chapter at Manipal.</p>

            <p>As a newly formed chapter, we wanted to <b>reach out to more female technologists and male allies</b>. This would enrich our idea pool, increase event participation and help us improve the quality of our events. Within a span of 8 months and with a team of 10 members, we conducted more than 5 unique signature events. This motivated us to collaborate with individuals from other diversity groups, technical clubs and colleges. In order to introduce them to our chapter, I created a website. <b>It elaborates our mission statement, areas of focus, events, team details and latest blog articles. </b>  </p>

            <p>With the help of the Ethereal template, I designed a fully responsive website over a weekend. The single page layout, modularity and horizontal scolling particularly drew my interest. I dabbled with a little HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

        <div class="tab__container">
             
        	<p>My first exposure to Actions on Google dates back to the Women Techmakers (WTM) Leads Summit in 2017. A live demonstration of the Women Techmakers India Chatbot inspired me to delve into Dialogflow. Coincidentally, Google Developers Group and Women Techmakers had lauched an <a href="https://events.withgoogle.com/indiabuildsactions/" style="color: #cd5c5c" >Actions on Google campaign</a> across India soon after. The campaign was themed <b>'Solve for India'</b>. I was determined to contribute to this cause.</p>

        	<p>After going through several actions on my Google Assistant app, I observed how <b>non-profits were using them to raise awareness regarding social issues and educational ventures</b>. Meanwhile, a #SheBleeds blog article on menstrual awareness, by my childhood friend, popped up on my Facebook news feed. Let me fast forward by few months - it was a pleasant surprise to hear that an alumnus from my college had founded a non-profit called #SheBleeds. Their mission reasonated with my beliefs. After a series of discussions with the founder, Yash Mehrotra, <b>I  collaborated with the non-profit</b> to design the She Bleeds chatbot. Being associated with such an encouraging group is truly a delight! You can find out more about #SheBleeds <a href="http://www.shebleeds.in/about.html" style="color: #cd5c5c">here</a>.</p>

        <h3 align="center">Analysing the Domain Trends for Winter Projects at IECSE</h3>
        <div class="changelog__item">
          <div class="changelog__detail">
            <p>While serving as the Vice-chairperson of the Institute of Engineers Computer Science Engineering (IECSE) Manipal, I was intrigued by an unexpected trend in selecting domains for winter tasks. Approximately 100 students had to select a set of domains based on their skills and interests, and provide <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_swnsCcJGMpdm5DVV9kZ0lLWUU/view?usp=sharing" style="color: #cd5c5c">feedback</a> after the mentorship session. The domains comprised Application Development, Web Development, Design, Competitive Coding and Research.<b> I observed a few students taking up an unexpected medley of domains</b> like competitive coding and design! Were these combinations influenced by individual interests or better domain mentors? </p>


            <p>Along with 2 other friends, I compared results obtained on performing frequent pattern mining with the sentiment analysis quotient on reviews given by mentees of different domains. The Apriori algorithm gave us 32 rules and we used the Naive Baye's classifier for sentiment analysis. Using these results, we <b>established relations between the technologies that were in demand, predicted domains with considerably low mentee satisfaction and studied the dependency of one domain on the other.</b> We also used a predictive model to <b>decide what a newcomer is  most likely to choose</b>, based on certain factors (features) like ‚Äòhaving a start up‚Äô and ‚Äòhaving artistic skills‚Äô.</p>

                </figure>

            <p>Finding the logic fuzzy? Let me illustrate a simple example. Assume that several students take up research in cryptography and digital design. They finish their winter project and give excellent reviews. <b>If minimally related domains like (research, design) are frequently occuring with a positive feedback, the mentors must be good.</b> On the contrary, if students have taken related domians like (design, front-end web dev) and have provided negative reviews, the mentors must be incompetent. There is a lot of scope for future work, especially in cases where students have mixed reviews towards different domains. </p>

        <h3 class="section__title" align="center">An Online Attendance System</h3>
        <p>Towards the beginning of my junior year, I noticed that our professors were facing a challenge with the new <a href="https://slcm.manipal.edu/loginForm.aspx" style="color: #cd5c5c">Student Life Cycle Management System</a>. Besides noting down our attendance manually, they had to visit our online portal to mark the absentees. Our software design technology professor mentioned about how time-consuming the entire process was. With this in mind, <b>I wanted to work towards a simple solution to automate the updation process.</b></p>

        <figure>
                    <img src="Images/sdt2.png" class="responsive" align="middle"  width="900px"/>

                </figure>

        <p>On approaching our faculty with a proposition, we were told that manual entry into the attendance register was mandatory for college records. Therefore, <b>we decided to build a web application that could recognize characters, save the content as a text file and transfer the textual content to the college portal.</b> We split the task into two stages. Initially, the photo of the attendance register sheet would be preprocessed on an Android platform (using OpenCV Android). Subsequently, the preprocessed image would be uploaded a web application for optical character recognition. Tesseract.js was used for the latter, and HTML5 and CSS was used to develop the front-end of the website. To run JSP pages on our website, we used the Apache Tomcat web server.  </p> 

        <p>My contributions include building an Android application for image enhancement. This involved de-noising, skew correction, thresholding and morphological operations like dilation. I also trained the Tesseract OCR for nearly 17 iterations, in order to recognize multiple English fonts. My team consisted of Vignesh and Anshul. Our guide, Prof. Sucheta Kolekar, proposed a deparmental collaboration :)</p>

            <p>A few months ago, I bumped into two presonal websites that spurred me into creating a personal portfolio. It is not uncommon for Deep Learning & Computer Vision enthusiasts to hear about Andrej Karpathy. While referring to his blog article on <i><a href="http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/"  style="color: #cd5c5c" >A Survival Guide to a PhD</a></i>, I discovered his <a href="https://cs.stanford.edu/people/karpathy/">academic website</a>. <b>It was systematic and comprehensive</b>. Methodically, he described his publication, talks, pet projects and teaching ventures. I also came across <a href="https://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/" style="color: #cd5c5c">Prof. Ken Perlin's website</a> and I have not seen a more engaging  portfolio so far! Almost instantaneously, I was motivated to make a personal website for myself. </p>

        <h3 class="section__title" align="center">An E-learning based Spell-Corrector</h3>
        <p>As an undergrad, I observed that a few freshers found it difficult to write code snippets during written exams while they were good at summarizing concepts or theoritical answers. And then there were a few who found it hard to memorize definitions but could write the most elegant pieces of code. I started asking my friends if they found it difficult to think in code and correlate both handwritten text and code. <b>Maybe it wasn't about the IQ of the student. Maybe it had to do with their exposure to digital media as children</b>. Either ways, a lack of correlation could reduce their coding speed and effeciency drastically.</p>

        <iframe src="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vRlagFDojawP0E3Rb4rxmURFiJoMRePkuVodcCjjtgB_cv4k78AeodcNkD8VV-jjcwCcVVj-UmCRtki/embed?start=false&loop=false&delayms=5000" frameborder="0" width="950" height="600"  mozallowfullscreen="true" webkitallowfullscreen="true" ></iframe>

        <p>Thence, my friend and I wanted to work on an Android application <b>to bridge the gap between traditional handwritten mode of leaning and e-learning among children</b>. Initially, the child is made to write a sentence on a white board. Our app accepts a camera captured, digitized image of the text as the input. Following this, the image is preprocessed and the characters are recognized using an OCR. The app consists of a spell corrector (inspired by Peret Norvig's algorithm) which checks the spelling of the text in the image and gives an error-free output. This allows the child to compare what she has written on the board with the corresponding text in the output. Not only will the app serve as a spelling corrector to hand-written text, but it will also prompt the child to compare both the texts simultaneously.</p>
