                <p> One of my most memorable ventures as a fresher was the Hashtag Project. Hashtag is the E-magazine of IECSE (the official CS club of Manipal). It was a privilege to contribute to the <a href="style="color: #cd5c5c"" style="color: #cd5c5c">Consumer Electronics Show</a> 2015 Section (CES) of the magazine with my team-mate Mayank. Our 2 a.m. stimulating discussions ranged from catchy phrases for new products to the specifics of some of the most bizarre technologies! Since we were launching the first edition of Hashtag, we had a very simple goal- <b>we wanted the students to know the latest technological developments around them.</b></p>

                <p>Before jumping into the details of our E-magazine, let's learn about CES. It is an annual technical convention held in January, at Las Vegas. Over 3900 <b>companies exhibit their latest technologies and products on this platform. </b>The conference hosts over 150,000 attendees and tech giants like Samsung, Sony, Nvidia etc. You will find a plethora of innovative technologies starting from immersive techology to 3-D printers.</p>

                <p>We've planned the layout and content of the magazine meticulously. Every page has a <b>Quick Bites</b> section which describes out-of-the-box products briefly, to keep the reader engrossed. The general section is far more detailed when it comes to technical specifics. Also, we've alloted <b>badges</b> to impressive products (these are the must-reads). While I handled the technical content, my team-mate did a fabulous job with the design!

            <p>Working with Dr. Sanjay Singh was a truly enriching experience of my college life. Although our interactions were brief, he taught me the art of presenting a research paper. In  the beginning, I was asked to go through papers from a list of reputed Journals of Machine Learning, Neural Networks and Data Mining. After 3 weeks of scrutiny, I decided to work along the lines of a <b><a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7933927" style="color: #cd5c5c">paper on Adscope</a></b>. Thereafter, I was asked to present the paper in a week. </p>

            <p>To give you a brief introduction to AdScope, let's understand the traditional process of analyzing data from a live search campaign. User queries that match campaign keywords, are sent from a service provider to an advertising expert.<b>The task of manually going through the queries to deem them relevant to the campaign, can be laborious.</b> Make note of the fact that relevant queries can imply potential customers or targets. To overcome the above-mentioned challenge, Ahmet Bulut et.al. designed a web-based interactive system called AdScope. It helps in assessing the relevance of a query to the ad campaign by using <b>relevance feedback</b> from users and advertisers, to rank queries.</p>

            <p>Most conferences provide approximately 15 minutes in presenting important aspects of one's paper. Since I was presenting an existing paper, I had to take references into account. Based on sir's 5 slide method, I systematically covered the <b>problem statement, previous work, recent work, critical analysis and future scope.</b> Based on his advice, I included a section themed <b>'why do I care'</b> or 'which aspects interest me'. The small details always matter. Little did I know that justifying interests would help me while drafting my SOP for a masters programme in CS. Please feel free to refer to my slides <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B_swnsCcJGMpbGp1R1B2NmNmUlh0Mi1hOFhsYUx6M0hYQ0Vn/view"  style="color: #cd5c5c">here</a></b>. </p>

        <div class="tab__container">

             
        	<p>It's one thing give a lightning talk amongst 4000 developers, it's another thing to face a group of PhD students, research assistants and professors for an hour. A different ball game altogether. Towards the end of my final year internship at IISc, I was asked to conduct a seminar within a week. I spoke about my project on classification, clustering, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation of Wireless Capsule Endoscopy images. Was it really necessary to conduct a seminar right after my internship? The motives behind this were plenty. </p>

          <p>To begin with, <b>I wanted to gain insignts on plausible solutions to the challenges in the future scope of my work</b>. To this end, I compiled a separate document detailing the suggestions by the audience. Several discussions with the PhD students made me realize that one of the challenges was rather benificial to my task. For example, a large number of benign image samples was not a problem; it could be leveraged for real-time classification of abnrmalities (since the system would encounter far more normal images in real-time). Secondly, <b>the talk required a thorough understanding of underlying concepts, and challenged my presentation and teaching skills</b>. Lastly, I had to <b>organize my talk</b> in order to present my work cogently.</p> 

          <p>Einstein rightly quoted,"If you can't explain it to six year old, you don't understand it yourelf". Similarly, a good presentation of one's work to a diverse audience, is indicative of concept clarity.  </p>

        <div class="changelog__item">
          <div class="changelog__detail">
            <p> Firstly, if you think we're crazy, you're on the right track. In 2016, I voiced out the idea of a futuristic jhadoo to a close friend. A 'jhadoo' is a broom in Hindi( the national language of Indians). Being an ardent fan of Harry Potter and a keen observer of details in our day to day lives, I envisoned a <b>multi-purpose tech broom</b>. When I described the specifics to my friend Mayank, he seemed to find the idea bizarre. We kept the idea on hold temporarily. However, a few months later, I received a pleasant surprise. I found a  booklet of our iJhadoo design at my doorstep (in case you're wondering where the prefix 'i' came from- we both had an obsession with Apple products). The impeccable designs are a result of Mayank's efforts while I contributed to the specifics to <i>our product.</i></p>

            <p>Wondering why we invested in such non-steretypical ventures? It's because everything starts with an idea. We wanted to <b>think out of the box in order to design technological tools that would help our community.</b> You could liken it to a mini <b>product ideation session.</b> Lastly, we were teenagers wishing to create the next big thing B) Also, this promotes Modi's Swachh Bharat initiative and can be the new Aam Aadmi party logo :P</p>

        <h3 class="section__title" align="center"  style="color:#753434">Futuristic Indian Footwear</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, <b>a design workshop can whet your appetite in the most unforseeable ways</b>. During my first year at college, I attended IECSE's Adobe Week Workshop on Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. A few days after the workshop, I spoke to my friend, Mayank, about flip flops (this was very random- let's not get into the specifics). To sum it all, within a span of an hour (at the cafeteria), we conceptualized the 'iChappal' and its features. 'Chappal' refers to flip flop slippers in the Hindi language. Also, all the dog references like the multi-coloured paw design and chew-proof sole were inspired by my pet dog, Ollie. Mayank played an instrumetal role in designing the iChappal. </p>

        <p>We didn't stop here; this inspired us to design the iJhadoo. <b>An important takeaway from this experience, is to actively participate in workshops. They broaden one's horizon and are gateways to collaborative learning.</b> Hopefully, we will come up with out-of-the-box ideas like Elon Musk, some day :') </p>

            <p>Under the guidance of Bhargav (an ex-Web Dev Head at IECSE), I learnt the basics of CSS and Java Script. I must confess that although Computer Vision and Image Processing always intrigued me, I wanted to explore areas of front-end web development. I observed that he modified the website of our technical club, and personalized it for his friends' birthdays. This motivated me and I approached him for help (or mentorship rather). The fact that <b>I could build something to give my ideas a form or turn them into reality</b>, fascinated me.  </p>

            <p>I created a login page for Women Techmakers Manipal. This was one of my weekend tasks (i.e. creating forms) as a beginner. Irrespective of whether you're a novice or not, <b>it doesn't hurt to ask your peers or classmates for help. I liken mentorship sessions to mutual knowledge enrichment (a symbiotic system)</b>. Indeed, there are many people who are willing to help, if you take the first step by asking them your queries.    </p>

        <p> I vivdly remember helping my senior (Swati Di) in setting up her poster for the Poster Presentation session at the Grace Hopper Conference India 2016. Thereafter, <b>a series of stimulating interactions ensued between her and the attendees</b>. Within a span of two hours, <b>the amount of knowledge exchage in a single platform was ineffable</b>.

        <p>For the 2017 submissions, I made a poster on Kannada Language Text Recognition on an Android Platform. This was a part of my second year internship at IISc. Although the initial poster submission got accepted with positive reviews, I could not upload the changes for the revised submissions using their template, on time (owing to my end-semster exams). Nevertheless, the feedback was informative and <b>I learnt the art of summarizing my work in 2 pages</b>.

            <p>Prior to using <a href="https://medium.com/"  style="color: #cd5c5c">Medium</a>, I was deciding between leveraging blogging platforms like WordPress and creating my own blog site from scratch. Although the latter was time consuming and devoid of certain plugins, I could <b>explore key principles of web design</b>. Furthermore, I had much more freedom to customize my website.   </p>

             <p>Ever since my childhood, I enjoyed painting and sketching. Given that I had sold several paintings at exhibitions, I thought that I was fairly creative when it came to web design. But I was mistaken; <b>aesthetics in web design</b> is altogether different. I could relate to Cameron Moll's quote, <b>"What separates design from art is that design is meant to be...functional</b>".</p>

            <p>When it comes to interoperability, reach and security and Wordpress is way ahead. Should a tyro still think of making a blog site? I'd say that a newbie should do both ;) However, if one aspires to become a blogging Ninja, using a blogging platform is a better option. <b>Medium</b> is a personal favourite!
